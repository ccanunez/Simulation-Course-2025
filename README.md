# Summary

These sources discuss **setting up and simulating stable N-body systems**, specifically focusing on **Plummer spheres**. The process involves **positioning particles according to a desired density distribution** (like the Plummer sphere) and then **assigning them appropriate velocities** using a distribution function based on escape velocity to ensure stability. The text also covers using **random number generators** for particle placement and velocity assignment, as well as **testing system stability** using Lagrangian radii. Finally, the sources introduce **simulating the effects of gas expulsion** on embedded star clusters, which can lead to "infant mortality" in young clusters.
